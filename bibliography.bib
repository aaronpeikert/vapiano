To facilitate situational assessment and economically measure these dimensions, we propose four ultra-brief one-item scales (S8-I, S8-II, S8-III-A, S8-III-P) validated against the already existing 24-item S8*. Convergent/discriminant validity of the four S8-scales was examined by analyses of the multi-characteristics multi-measures matrix, and their nomological associations with external criteria were compared. Application areas of the scales are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Time-sampling conventions are investigated by means of (i) an analysis of event recorded observations and (ii) a computer simulation. The abilities of each convention to approximate to the actual value on measures of frequency, duration and bout-length are compared. For each comparison the distributions of the bouts of behaviour and the inter-bout intervals are known. Of the conventions compared, ‘one-zero’ sampling appears to be the least satisfactory. ‘Instantaneous’ sampling and ‘predominant activity’ sampling give better approximations under most circumstances. However, depending upon the parameters of the behaviour studied, all three conventions can give accurate or inaccurate estimates on particular measures. Recommendations concerning the use of the conventions are made.},

  abstract = {Situations can be seen as having attributes or qualities in much the same way as people have traits. The structure of people's perceptions of these situation qualities was explored. A comprehensive list of adjectives that might describe situations was generated, and people rated situations using samples of the words. Across several samples of words and participants and several analytic methods, four factors show up regularly (positivity, negativity, productivity, and ease of negotiation). In a second study, it was shown that these factors predict the way in which people freely sort situations. The conceptual nature of these factors and of situation qualities is discussed, with particular emphasis on how people's goals and perceived outcomes influence their perceptions of situations.

On four separate occasions over several weeks, 202 undergraduate participants described a situation they encountered the previous day and their behavior. Analyses considered overall congruence as well as distinctive congruence, adjusted for the match of personality and behavior to the normative personality and behavior profile. Overall congruence was strongly associated with better psychological adjustment; distinctive congruence was not. Similarly, situation strength and affordances for autonomy, relatedness to others, and competence were strongly linked to overall congruence, but only weakly associated with distinctive congruence. Behaving in accordance with one’s true self is only related to positive psychological outcomes when it is accordance with normative standards.},

  abstract = {A new method for assessing situations is employed to examine the association between situational similarity, personality, and behavioral consistency across ecologically representative contexts. On 4 occasions across 4 weeks, 202 undergraduate participants (105 women, 97 men) wrote descriptions of a situation they had experienced the previous day. In addition, they rated its psychological features using the recently developed Riverside Situational Q-Sort (RSQ) Version 2.0 (Wagerman \& Funder, 2009) and their behavior using the Riverside Behavioral Q-Sort (RBQ) Version 3.0 (Funder, Furr, \& Colvin, 2000; Furr, Wagerman, \& Funder, 2010). Independent judges also rated the situations using the RSQ, on the basis of the participants' written descriptions. Results indicated (a) participants' ratings of their behavior were impressively consistent across the 4 situations; (b) the 4 situations experienced by a single participant tended to be described more similarly to each other than to situations experienced by different participants; (c) situational similarity, especially from the individual's own point of view, strongly predicted behavioral consistency; and (d) personality characteristics predicted behavioral consistency even after controlling for situational similarity. Relatively consistent persons described themselves as ethically consistent, conservative, calm and relaxed, and low on neuroticism. These results imply that behavioral consistency in daily life stems from multiple sources, including situation selection and the distinctive influence of personality, and further suggest that tools for situational assessment such as the RSQ can have wide utility.},

INTRODUCTION Acknowledgments First of all, I would like to thank my beloved fiancée, Petronella Frisk, for putting up with me spending evenings and weekends writing this book. Thank you for your patience and support! I couldn’t have done it without you! Many thanks to Tom Skinner for helping me with the initial reviews of the chapters and with testing the examples. Your help has been immensly valuable to me. If not for you, the book would have been a lot poorer. I would also like to thank you for your words of encouragement at the times when I needed it the most. Also thanks to Charlie Irish, who helped proofread Chapter 5, before I used it as a beta chapter. My former college Chris Jangelöv has been a source of inspiration over the years. I probably owe it to him that I entered into the world of web standards, usability, and blogging in the first place. Thank you, Chris, for always having new ideas and being encouraging.},

  abstract = {Presents a meta-analysis of 38 articles containing job analysis interrater reliability (IR) data. This study investigated the levels of IR within specific combinations of moderators, such as rater source, experience of the rater, and type of job descriptive information. Results show that the overall mean IR of 91 reliability coefficients reported in the literature was .59. The results of experienced professionals (job analysts) show the highest reliability coefficients. The method of data collection (job contact vs job description) only affected the results of experienced job analysts. For this group, higher IR coefficients were obtained for analyses based on job contact than for those based on job descriptions. For other rater categories, neither the method of data collection nor training had a significant effect on IR. Analyses based on scales with defined levels resulted in significantly higher IR coefficients than analyses based on scales with undefined levels. Behavior and job worth dimensions were rated more reliable than attributes and tasks. Furthermore, results indicate that when nonprofessional raters are used, at least 2 to 4 raters are required to obtain a reliability coefficient of .80. These findings have implications for research and practice. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

As predicted, engagement-contingent, completion-contingent, and performance-contingent rewards significantly undermined free-choice intrinsic motivation (d = –0.40, –0.36, and –0.28, respectively), as did all rewards, all tangible rewards, and all expected rewards. Engagement-contingent and completion-contingent rewards also significantly undermined self-reported interest (d = –0.15, and –0.17), as did all tangible rewards and all expected rewards. Positive feedback enhanced both free-choice behavior (d = 0.33) and self-reported interest (d = 0.31). Tangible rewards tended to be more detrimental for children than college students, and verbal rewards tended to be less enhancing for children than college students. The authors review 4 previous meta-analyses of this literature and detail how this study's methods, analyses, and results differed from the previous ones.

The procedure essentially involves the construction of functions of the observed proportions which are directed at the extent to which the observers agree among themselves and the construction of test statistics for hypotheses involving these functions. Tests for interobserver bias are presented in terms of first-order marginal homogeneity and measures of interobserver agreement are developed as generalized kappa-type statistics. These procedures are illustrated with a clinical diagnosis example from the epidemiological literature.},

An emerging theme within environmental psychology argues that physical features of the environment might work both directly on outcomes and interactively with either psychosocial work elements. In the present study, the interaction of noise with psychosocial job stress was explored for 128 office workers employed by a government agency in a city in the Midlands region of the UK. The results showed no direct effect of ambient noise levels upon job satisfaction, well-being or organizational commitment. However, lower levels of ambient noise were found to buffer the negative impact of psychosocial job stress upon these same three outcomes. Psychosocial job stress is, therefore, seen as a valuable heuristic in operationazing the context of sound events at work.},
